What I learned:
List Operations
aList[i] - This access your list at index i. An index is a numeric value that represents the position of an element within that data structure. For example, the first element of aList is at index 1, represented by aList[1].
x <- aList[i] - Assigns value of aList[i] to variable x
aList[i] <- x - Assigns value of x to aList[i]
aList[i] <- aList[j] - Assigns value of aList[j] to aList[i]

INSERT(aList, i , value) - aList is the list in which you want to insert the value. i is the index at which you want to insert the value. value is the value you want to insert at that index
APPEND(aList, value) - The value you put in is placed at the end of aList
REMOVE(aList, i) - aList is the list in which you want to delete the value. i is the index at which you want to delete the value.
LENGTH(aList) - Gives you the number of elements in aList

FOR EACH item IN aList { blah blah blah } - Item is a var assigned each element of aList in order from first element to last. The code inside the for loop is run once for every assignment of item.

Homework:
Slicing the list to get elements from index 1 to 3 (exclusive)

sliced_elements = my_list[1:4]

Modifying the second element of the list

my_list[1] = 'blueberry'

Appending a new element to the list

my_list.append('fig')

Inserting a new element at a specific index

my_list.insert(2, 'cantaloupe')

Removing an element from the list

removed_element = my_list.pop(3)
print(my_list)

#2:
import math
def worst_case_binary_search_iterations(array_length):
return math.ceil(math.log2(array_length))

Determine worst case number of iterations for an array of length 20

array_length = 20
worst_case_iterations = worst_case_binary_search_iterations(array_length)
print(f"The worst case number of iterations for an array of length {array_length} is {worst_case_iterations}.")

#3:
A because it is multiplying every value in the list by 2
