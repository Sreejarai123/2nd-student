This is my trimester one reflection:
## Main things I learned
- one important thing I learned is psuedo code: a code that uses word like things and is what the AP colleeboard exams are in 
- Additionally I learned vocab like booleans, if then statements, lists and procedures, algorithoms, libraries, etc from all the student teachings which are in my blogs organized 
- I learned what a backend is and how to create API's: use the website rapidapi to get the api key and then need to create fetch, get, and endpoints for the things to work
- then if you get the local link then you can add that into the frontend and that can be used to link the frontend code to the backend code
- additionally from the practice college board quiz I learned topics that I still need help on like how to identify the boolean and putting those terms from the student teachings into practice. 
- Some good points: I think I really imporved my css skills and feel pretty comfertable coding on the frontend
- Some things to work on: While the frontend was a good process this trimester I think we need to become more comfertable in designing a way prettier frontend, we also need to learn how to activeley understand the backend and the goals and code that we are inputting into it.
