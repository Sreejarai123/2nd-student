How to do simple operators in JS
Use the “+” operator to add two numbers in JavaScript

Use the “-“ operator to subtract two numbers in JavaScript

Use the “*” operator to multiply two numbers in JavaScript

Use the “/” operator to divide two numbers in JavaScript

Use the “%” operator to get the remainder of a division operation in JavaScript

Iterating
Iteration is going through a set of laws or objectives for the loops to complete. This allows for the desired objective to be completed.

Randomization
Raandomization is used to generate a random number. For example, RANDOM(a,b) would generate any number from a to b. Each result from randomization is equally likely to occur. Each execution might produce a different result.


Homework:
List of test grades

test_grades = [85, 92, 78, 90, 88, 76, 94, 89, 81, 87]

Calculate the median

median_grade = statistics.median(test_grades)

Print the median test grade

print("The median test grade is: {median_grade}") (edited)

HW 2:
import random
def guess_the_number():
Generate random number
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
Set the initial number of tries
tries = 0
print("Welcome to the Guess the Number game!")
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")
while True:
Ask the player to guess the number
guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
Increment the number of tries
tries += 1
Check if the guess is correct
if guess == secret_number:
print(f"Congratulations! You guessed the number {secret_number} in {tries} tries.")
break
elif guess < secret_number:
print("Too low. Try again.")
else:
print("Too high. Try again.")
if name == "main":
guess_the_number()
