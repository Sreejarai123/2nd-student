 things that worked:
- learned how to make buttons on homepage:
- this is the code for that
basically you just do this:    <a href="http://127.0.0.1:4200/student/2023/08/26/game.html">Game</a>
- in the place of the link you can replace it with whatever you want it to link to
- improved style and css for our project learned how to create subsections, add in images, and change the colors for different pages and sections
- learned what api's are for future use rapid api for specific apis and there key
- for linking we had difficulty with this but: need to make a get, request and fetch statement: using the local link or the aws deployed page you can deploy and link the backend to frontend
Difficulties I faced:
- we had lots of difficulties, as scrum master and backend handler one challenge I faced was making sure we were always on task, one thing to imporve this is to actively make adjustments to our plan because once we got behind or confused the plan was kind of abandoned so one important thing is to make sure we are always on top of it
- for the backend we faced lots of difficulties getting our backend api to actually work one thing that helped was we watched a bunch of youtube tutorials, went to cs tutorials and asked our friends for help
- from this I learned that the issue was that we didn't add in our api to the main.py so we always need to make sure to do that and also add in endpoints
