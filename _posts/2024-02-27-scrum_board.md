## Our Scrum Board Done By Sreeja Rai:
- By January 20th we wanted to be done with our login page since there was a spot check coming up. For this we all collaboratevily created our own individual login pages and signup pages to help each other in the long run
- Abby and Sreeja mainly worked on the login page and tanvi and chrissie worked on the singup page. For this we had to make sure our postman and backend was working we all had our own backend but in the end used sreeja's backend. 
- At this point our login page was working however, we were having trouble with our singup page and the database.
- We found this to be a result of our mismatched python versions so we switched everything from python3 to just bieng python
- once we got our singup pages and login pages to work we left those alone and changed the formatting so that it was a cute color and font bieng centered on our accounts page. 
- Our next set of deadlines was only night of the musuem and the qualification date:
- in order to meet this deadline our games needed to be completed
- For majority of our games we had our own css file, html file, and js file, and then collectivly we created one big html file and css file for the actual layout of our website. 
- At this point we had all brainstormed roughly what we wanted our games to be
- Abby worked on creating a chemical version of 2048 in which rather than having numbers they were replaced by elements that went from smaller to bigger on the periodic table, she also included an API that allows for users to store their highest score on the games (we had trouble creating this)
- Sreeja created a flappy bird game using js in which the bird is replaced by a scientist who is making his way through. Following the chemistry theme this was done by allowing for the space key, mouse or w key to move the scientist up and by not pressing anything the scientist would go down. Similairly, there is an API that allows for the storing of the users best score.
- Tanvi created a chemical matching game using js. This made it so that you could choose your grid size and how many cards are present. The game times the users and allows for them to make note of their fastest times.
- Chrissie created a game of tetris in which the user can use the arrow keys to move the blocks and then their score gets presented on the side and can be saved depending on the user.
- By febuary 6th we had everything finished because this was the date for night of the musuem qualifications: we did everything till then but we ran out of space at night of the musuem
