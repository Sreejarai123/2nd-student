## Chrissie's Review
- I made the color shifter using binary shift. I orriginally worked on the binary translator with Abby, but then I started to work on the color shifter. This part of the project takes the binary and converts it to colors. You click the button and it shifts the binary to the left so that a 0 is added to the right and the 1's are shifted 1 to the left. This changes the color that is presented because the color is determined by the arrangement of the 1's and 0's in the binary. 

## Sreeja's Review
- In the project the main thing I worked on was the Binary translator: In this I created the Binarytotext function and the TexttoBinary functions, I also added the shift button which when clicked switches all the zeros to ones and the ones to zeros
- The next thing that I worked on was the SASS for the page, with this we struggled to get a consolidated theme going throughout the pages. However, we did get it up and running by creating a black text box, white background and a centered text in style.scss file
- My key commits was for the binary translator, as well as for the style.scss
- however, one thing that still isn't working is my make so what I would do is I would try it out on my individual page and then add the code into a google doc and then they would review and add it into the group page. 
- one thing that I can work on in the future is working with SASS and not making a seperate style for each page also I can work on fixing my make so that I can have more contributions on the group page. 


## Abby's Review
- Towards the beginning of the project, I worked on the binary translator. Chrissie and I had the idea together and worked on it in the beginning. Together we completed the final version of the binary translator. Then we were introduced to SASS and I switched to work on that. I added a black backgroud and centered, white font on our project. This was pulled from the minima page that was introduced to us, then I modified it to fit our needs. The buttons on the translator and the color wheel come from the SASS format that we used, so is the format of the entire binary translator and color shift. 

## Tanvi's Review
- I worked on the binary flashcards for the prokject. We used similar ones for our passion project, so the code was very similar as well. 
- One of the main struggles that I dealed with was changing the color for the background, text, and option choices.
