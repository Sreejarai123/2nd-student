## questions I got wrong
Question 62: Which selection statement will display true:
I put answer choice C but the correct answer was A Since x is true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x OR y evaluates to true, true is displayed.
Question 64: error with multiplication using repeated addition: I put answer choice A and B however, it was B and D Since y is initially negative, the loop condition count â‰¥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.

## what I learned
- overall the quiz went pretty well I got two wrong so I got a 65/67 which is a 97% which is not bad at all most of it was common sense
