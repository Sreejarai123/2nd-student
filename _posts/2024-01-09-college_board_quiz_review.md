## questions I got wrong
- Question 62: Which selection statement will display true:
I put answer choice C but the correct answer was A Since x is true, the body of the IF statement is executed. Since x OR y evaluates to true, true is displayed.
- Question 64: error with multiplication using repeated addition: I put answer choice A and B however, it was B and D Since y is initially negative, the loop condition count â‰¥ y is initially true, so the body of the loop is never executed and 0 is returned.

## what I learned
- overall the quiz went pretty well I got two wrong so I got a 65/67 which is a 97% which is not bad at all most of it was common sense
- One thing that was better then the last college board quizes is that I made sure to check it with my friends and then push it to check what I was doing wrong before I submitted it
- for next time I should try to do it all by myself and then look to my friends for help
- If I am lost on a question they have videos based on the question I can watch to get help
- Most of these questions are based off of common sense so make sure to really just read the question: I was getting them wrong on the ones I spent the least amount of time on.
