## This is our planning for our key features:
- we all wanted to make each of our own individual games. We knew that we wanted the games to have a general theme of either chemistry or learning features that enhance and hone in our skills. 
- With this in mind we divied up the project and decided to collaborate on key features like the login page, the read me, and descriptions on each of the games


## Our deadlines:
- By January 20th we wanted to be done with our login page since there was a spot check coming up. For this we all collaboratevily created our own individual login pages and signup pages to help each other in the long run
- Abby and Sreeja mainly worked on the login page and tanvi and chrissie worked on the singup page. For this we had to make sure our postman and backend was working we all had our own backend but in the end used sreeja's backend. 
- At this point our login page was working however, we were having trouble with our singup page and the database.
- We found this to be a result of our mismatched python versions so we switched everything from python3 to just bieng python
- once we got our singup pages and login pages to work we left those alone and changed the formatting so that it was a cute color and font bieng centered on our accounts page. 
- Our next set of deadlines was only night of the musuem and the qualification date:
- in order to meet this deadline our games needed to be completed
- For majority of our games we had our own css file, html file, and js file, and then collectivly we created one big html file and css file for the actual layout of our website. 
- At this point we had all brainstormed roughly what we wanted our games to be
- Abby worked on creating a chemical version of 2048 in which rather than having numbers they were replaced by elements that went from smaller to bigger on the periodic table, she also included an API that allows for users to store their highest score on the games (we had trouble creating this)
- Sreeja created a flappy bird game using js in which the bird is replaced by a scientist who is making his way through. Following the chemistry theme this was done by allowing for the space key, mouse or w key to move the scientist up and by not pressing anything the scientist would go down. Similairly, there is an API that allows for the storing of the users best score.
- Tanvi created a chemical matching game using js. This made it so that you could choose your grid size and how many cards are present. The game times the users and allows for them to make note of their fastest times.
- Chrissie created a game of tetris in which the user can use the arrow keys to move the blocks and then their score gets presented on the side and can be saved depending on the user.

## troubles we faced:
- we initially faced trouble with our singup page as it was not working since it was not connected to our database and squlite once we fixed this we got our sign up page to work which allowed us to create and add users
- Additionally this tri we had trouble meeting the deadlines because simple changes were resulting in a lot of things breaking and we often had trouble shoot and find ways to fix them in short amount of times
- One instance was night of the musuem qualification in which the line was to long and we did not get to present until thursday and as a result even though we qualified could not make it to night of the museam
- Initially we faced a lot of confusion on what games we wanted to create in order for them to still be on theme with our chemical ideas. In this process Sreeja changed her game many times as there were not that many features. For the qualification Sreeja presented a basic ping pong game. However, this did not have nearly enough features and was looking really rushed. In order to improve her game which she always wanted as flappy bird, over the break, she started to create the game using the similair js code as the ping pong game, she added in features like the saving the highest score, and also used images and png to make the game look prettier and more closely similair to the real life version of flappy bird
- for tanvi’s game, she had trouble on picking a game idea initially. She decided on a memory game, but this was challenging as she didn’t know how to add in different grid levels. It kept giving her errors and she finally got it to work with 5 different difficulty levels. She also had problems with making the message after you finished the game.
- Abby had trouble linking the backend to the login and signup page, and then I was able to use postman to create the api that links the two. I also had trouble getting the high score to save in 2048, but then was able to do so using an api that stores data.
- Chrissie had trouble with creating her tetris game and the aesthetic she wanted. This resulted in many changes to her game after night of the musuem.
