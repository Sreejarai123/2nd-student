What I learned:
- Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm. It repeats a specified number of times or when a condition succeeds.
- In computer science, one of the fundamental concepts is looping and iteration. Using loops in code allows programmers to shorten a thousand lines of code into less than five lines. One of those loops is known as a “for loop” used to iterate through some sequence. Some examples would be a list, string, dictionary, etc. Using the if statement within a for loop is common practice, with this code block as an example.




Homework:
#1:
def describe_daytime(daytime, activities):
if not activities:
return
else:
current_activity = activities[0]
print(f"At {daytime}, I usually: {current_activity}")
remaining_activities = activities[1:]
describe_daytime(daytime, remaining_activities)

Define lists of activities for different times of the day

morning_activities = [
"Wake up",
"Exercise",
"Have breakfast",
"Get ready for work",
]

afternoon_activities = [
"Have lunch",
"Attend meetings",
"Work on projects",
"Take a short break",
]

evening_activities = [
"Have dinner",
"Relax and watch TV",
"Spend time with family",
"Prepare for the next day",
]

Call the recursive function for each time of the day

describe_daytime("Morning", morning_activities)
print("\n")
describe_daytime("Afternoon", afternoon_activities)
print("\n")
describe_daytime("Evening", evening_activities)

#2:
def fibonacci(x):
if x==1:
return(0) # First terminating statement
if x == 2:
return(1) # Second terminating statement
else:
return(fibonacci(x-1)+ fibonacci(x-2))
for i in range(8):
print(fibonacci(i+1))
You need two terminating statements because they provide the necessary conditions for the function to stop recurring. They act as stopping criteria, ensuring that the recursive function ends when it reaches these specific positions in the Fibonacci sequence.
