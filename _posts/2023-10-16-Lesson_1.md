What it was on

- this was on algorithoms: 
- Definition: A finite set of instructions to accomplish a task

- string Algorithims
- Palindrome: takes user input and converts to a palindrome by duplicating the string backwards. Users can choose to duplicate last character or not.
- Constraints: defaults to no duplication unless user types exactly “yes”
- A palindrome string or number is the same read forwards or backwards. Simple as that.
Ex.
“bob”
“hannah”

Homework: 

input_string = "racecar"
reversed_string = input_string[::-1]
print(reversed_string, "is a palindrome")
mystr = str(input("racecar: "))
mybool = input("Would you like to make a palindrome with this string?").lower()
if mybool == "yes":
secondstr = mystr[::-1]
else:
secondstr = mystr[:-1]
secondstr = secondstr[::-1]
endresult = mystr+secondstr
print(endresult)

array = [3, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2]
array.sort()
print(array)
