Homework:

#1:

Get user input for citizenship status and age

citizen_status = input("Are you a citizen? (yes/no): ").lower()
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

Check if the user is a citizen and 18 or older

is_citizen = citizen_status == "yes"
is_18_or_older = age >= 18

Use boolean logic to determine eligibility

is_eligible_to_vote = is_citizen and is_18_or_older

Display the result

if is_eligible_to_vote:
print("You are eligible to vote. Go ahead and cast your vote!")
else:
print("Sorry, you are not eligible to vote. Please wait until you meet the criteria.")

#2:

Get user input for salary and years of service

salary = float(input("Enter your salary: "))
years_of_service = int(input("Enter your years of service: "))

Check if the employee is eligible for a bonus (more than 5 years of service)

is_eligible_for_bonus = years_of_service > 5

Calculate the bonus amount (5% of salary) if eligible

if is_eligible_for_bonus:
bonus_percentage = 5
bonus_amount = (bonus_percentage / 100) * salary
print(f"Congratulations! You are eligible for a {bonus_percentage}% bonus.")
print(f"Net bonus amount: ${bonus_amount:.2f}")
else:
print("Sorry, you are not eligible for a bonus at this time.")
#3:

Get user input for marks

marks = float(input("Enter your marks: "))

Determine the grade based on the given rules

if marks < 25:
grade = "F"
elif 25 <= marks < 45:
grade = "E"
elif 45 <= marks < 50:
grade = "D"
elif 50 <= marks < 60:
grade = "C"
elif 60 <= marks < 80:
grade = "B"
else:
grade = "A"

Display the corresponding grade

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
