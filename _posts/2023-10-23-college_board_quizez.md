## How was the test
- overall the test was good
- these are some topics that I think I need to work on because they were difficult
- one topic that i need to work on is the ones where two answer choices are very similair

## Score and explanations on the wrong questions
- I got a 58/66 so I got eight questions wrong
- I got question one wrong: I put D however it was B because: This option is correct. The code segment assigns the initial value of first to temp, then assigns the initial value of second to first. The initial value of first, which has been stored in temp, is then assigned to second. Therefore, the initial values of first and second have been interchanged.
- I got question nine wrong next: I put option B but it was answer D: This option is correct. Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.
- The next question I got wrong was 11 where I accidently put answer A when I meant to put D because This option is correct. The code segment selects "Yellow" one-sixth of the time, "Blue" one-sixth of the time, and "Red" the
remaining two-thirds of the time.
- I also got question 14 wrong where the correct answer was option C because This option is correct. The programs each display ten values, but each value displayed by program B is one greater than the corresponding value from program A. Program A displays 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and program B displays  2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
- I also got question twenty one wrong which was on comparing robot algorithoms the correct answer was B because This option is correct. This code segment moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it right three times so that the robot faces the top of the grid, and then moves the robot forward three squares to the gray square.
- I also got question 26 wrong where the correct answer was B because This option is correct. This code segment rotates right whenever there is an open square to the right. The robot will move forward from its initial location to the upper-left corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, then rotate right, then move down two squares, then rotate right, then move forward to the gray square.
- I also got question 31 wrong where the correct answer was actually C not D because This option is correct. Program I correctly moves the robot to the gray square by repeatedly moving the robot forward, rotating left, moving forward, and rotating right. Program II correctly moves the robot to the gray square by moving the robot forward to the upper-right corner of the grid, rotating left, and moving forward to the upper-left corner of the grid.
- I also got question 57 wrong which was on generating happy from harp and puppy where the correct answer B because This option is correct. This expression concatenates the first two letters of Open quotation, Harp, close quotation with the last three letters of Open quotation, puppy, close quotation, resulting
in Open quotation, Happy, close quotation.
