## How was the test
- overall the test was good
- these are some topics that I think I need to work on because they were difficult
- one topic that i need to work on is the ones where two answer choices are very similair
- havent finished the test yet but I finished more than half roughly 36 questions and the main ones I had to look up where the ones in suedo code where they had the code and asked me too determine the output and the other type of question
