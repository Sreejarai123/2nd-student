## My Grade:
- I think I deserve a 3.80 because I did all the hacks and I went above and beyond by even creating a theme for my project by making it tied to a coloring game and making it a little more advanced after each trial. 

## Peer Review by Anusha: 3.85
- Good job applying the concepts learned in class to your code. I like how you developed different parts of your coloring game before putting it all together. I like how you used a mix of both html, javascript, and Dom
- all of the hacks were followed from the rubric but you could have gone above and beyond to make it more personalized because the coloring game was only for putting all of it together which made the other ones seem more basic
- nice job adding the utterance comments
- your DOM section follows the rubric but a lot of things don't have a lot of personalization to it which would have been better. 
- overall you had everything and did a little more personalization

## what to fix
- in the future if we had a passion project decided we could have tied it in more to make it look more personlized rather than just looking like the hacks given to us.
