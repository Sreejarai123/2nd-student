## Team Teaches

### The Internet: I was absent on this day so I submitted it once I got back I got a 0.9/1 and this was because it was late

### Routing and Computing: I was absent on this day and did not do the homework

### Beneficial and Harmful Effects: I got a 0.85 for this lesson because I was absent so I was a little confused on the actual lesson itself and therefore I was not able to go that in depth and therefore I got a lower score

### Digital Divide: I was absent and submitted it to Mr. Lopez

### Computing Bias: I got a 0.87 because my answer to question two was incorrect because they were looking for an unintentional bias. 

### Undecided Problems: I was absent on this day so I submitted to Mr. Lopez

### Crowdsourcing: I got a 0.94/1 and they said that they liked the exmples that they gave me

### Legal Ethical Concerns: I was absent so took the quiz and got on my second try a 15/15 but on my first try I got a 14/15 submitted to the creators and to Mr. Lopez

### Safe Computing: This was our lesson, In this I helped to create the lesson plan using oline sources, watching the college board vidoes and by doing the quizes and seeing what I got wrong and what was hard. I was absent the day of the presentation but I helped to create the presentation and Tanvi presented my parts.
