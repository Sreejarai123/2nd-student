### Summary of Accomplishments
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  
- Added in week 1 hacks
    - Added in snake game, pizza game, quiz on me, weather app, python calculator and graphing calculator.
- Recreated our repositories and alligned it with the new version that was pushed out
- Had out live review and added a markdown table to the home page
- had a couple challenges with the make command working so in turn had to reinstall the whole bundle again and restarted my computer and after a couple tries it ended up working. Also had issues with getting my new pages to show up in other location that were not week 1.
- Added in a markdown table using html and then used html to add in a quiz about me that has a multiple choice section
- next week want to figure out how to fix the layout of my blogs and begin to add/ create checkilists that show what I need to do for the week.
