### Summary of Accomplishments
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  
- Added in week 1 hacks
    - Added in free form image on me and fixed and created my home page to be descriptive about me
- Recreated our repositories and alligned it with the new version that was pushed out
- Had our live review and added a markdown table to the home page
- had a couple challenges with the make command working so in turn had to reinstall the whole bundle again and restarted my computer and after a couple tries it ended up working. Also had issues with getting my new pages to show up in other location that were not week 1. Additionally we had to finish installing all the commands and files to ensure that everything would work.
- Added in a markdown table using html 
- next week want to figure out how to fix the layout of my blogs and begin to add/ create checkilists that show what I need to do for the week. Also want to add in more hacks and games that make our page more fun
