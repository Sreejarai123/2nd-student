### Summary of Accomplishments
> Update Blog to contain all hacks.  
- Added in week 2 hacks
    - Added in snake game, pizza game, quiz on me, weather app, python calculator and graphing calculator.
- Recreated our repositories and alligned it with the new version that was pushed out
- this was difficult because we ran into technical difficulties with our make command and ended up having to reinstall the commands in order to make it more organized and better to look at
- Had our live review and added a markdown table to the week 3 hacks
- had a couple challenges with the make command working so in turn had to reinstall the whole bundle again and restarted my computer and after a couple tries it ended up working. Also had issues with getting my new pages to show up in other location that were not week 1.
- Also had issues with creating the mark down and getting the hacks and posts to show up
- Added in a markdown table using html and then used html to add in a quiz about me that has a multiple choice section, need to figure out how to get the submit button to work
- next week want to figure out how to fix the layout of my blogs and begin to add/ create checkilists that show what I need to do for the week. Maybe even create our own layout.
