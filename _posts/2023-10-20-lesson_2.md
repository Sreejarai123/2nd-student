Data Abstraction:
- varaibles: an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value
- A variable can be thought of as a container or a box that holds information that your program can use or modify
- Variables help you manage and organize your work with data, making your code more organized, readable, and adaptable.

Homework: 
var1 = 7
var2 = 9
var3 = 2
var4 = 8
VAR = [var1, var2, var3, var4]
print(VAR)

float1 = 10
float2 = 2
print(float1/float2)
​​
var1 = 7
var2 = 9
var3 = 2
var4 = 8
VAR = [var1, var2, var3, var4]
print(VAR)

var1 = "hello,"
var2 = "how are you"
print(var1, var2)
